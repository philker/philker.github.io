<p>Abstract: I study how negative signals about states' capacity to provide security, i.e. terrorism, affect preference for democracy. I argue that negative signals affect preference formation differently conditional on how democratic a regime is perceived to be. Using interrupted surveys from several African countries, I show that preference for democracy increases in response to terrorist attacks. This effect is particularly pronounced among individuals who evaluate their state as undemocratic. Individuals who perceive their state as democratic show no adverse reaction towards democracy. The results provide a positive outlook on the resilience of preference for democracy in the face of adversity.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/philker/Distributive-politics-and-asymmetric-mobilization-/blob/main/asymmetric_mobilization.pdf">Distributive politics and asymmetric mobilization</a> </strong>(with Victor Araújo)</p>

<p>Abstract: Can broadly targeted welfare policy create electoral dynamics similar to particularistic strategies? We theorize a novel mechanism, we call asymmetric mobilization, which explains mobilization as a self-selection process induced by a broadly targeted benefit. Asymmetric mobilization is based on incomplete information of citizens about the de facto allocation of benefits. When citizens expect particularistic allocation, and access to the benefit depends on voter registration, supporters of the incumbent, who supplies the benefit, self-select into the electorate. This creates an incumbency advantage. We illustrate the argument using the case of the Renda Básica de Cidadania (RBC) in Maricá, Brazil, the largest unconditional cash transfer program in Latin America. Based on qualitative evidence we develop our argument in a formal model, which we test against novel survey data. We find that under the de facto procedure of implementation, supporters of the incumbent supplying the RBC, self-select into the electorate, and engage more in activities, which signal party loyalty.</p>

<p><strong><a href="">Accountability despite misinformation: The electoral impact of intensive units during Covid in Brazil</a> </strong>(with Victor Araújo)</p>

<p>Abstract: Do voters hold poorly performing politicians accountable in an environment of radical misinformation? We study this question through the lens of health care access during the Covid-19 pandemic in Brazil. The Bolsonaro administration had assumed an anti-scientific position in its course of action and later tried to frame their behavior as successful pandemic management. Based on a comprehensive typology of political information processing, we argue that voters in electoral districts with better access to intensive care units (ICUs) were more exposed to information contradicting the administration's narratives and actions. Using voting results on the electoral district level from all voting stations in Brazil, we confirm that higher ICU access leads voters to punish the Bolsonaro administration more at the ballot.    </p>

<p>Abstract: A short policy report – in German – about the impact of the first occurrences of Covid-19 during the municipal elections in Bavaria on electoral outcomes. Comparing changes of electoral outcomes within municipalities with and without Covid-19 cases, we do not find any evidence that voters were abstaining due to local Covid-19 incidence.

<p>Abstrakt: Am 15. März 2020 fanden in Bayern die Kommunalwahlen statt – mitten in den Anfangswochen der Coronapandemie in Deutschland. In etwa einem Fünftel der bayerischen Landkreise gab es zu diesem Zeitpunkt aber noch keinen bestätigten Coronafall. Wir vergleichen das Wahlverhalten in diesen Landkreisen mit bayerischen Landkreisen, in denen bereits Corona nachgewiesen wurde. Unsere Ergebnisse deuten nicht darauf hin, dass lokale Coronafälle die Wahlbeteiligung negativ beeinflusst haben. Die Wähler haben sich nicht abschrecken lassen.
