    <p>Hi! I'm Philipp, a PhD candidate at the Department of Political Science (IPZ) at the University of Zürich (UZH) and the Center for Comparative and International Studies (CIS), ETH and UZH. My supervisor is Prof. Katharina Michaelowa.</p>
   
    <p>My research area is Political Economy and Development. While my interests are broad, I substantively focus on issues related to political representation and accountability in the Global South. Beyond its intrinsic value, people having a political voice, underpins the development of inclusive institutions, which are necessary to improve social welfare. In my research, I seek to contribute on theoretical and empirical grounds, as I believe in a strong complementarity between both. To structure my theoretical thinking, I often resort to formal modeling. In my empirical work, I use quantitative methods to analyze a wide range of data. Being trained in Political Science and Economics, I aspire to foster the growing connection between both fields. </p>
