<p>Hi! I'm a phd candidate at the Department of Political Science (IPZ) at the University of Zürich (UZH) and the Center for Comparative and International Studies (CIS), ETH and UZH. My supervisor is Prof. Katherina Michaelowa.</p>
<p>Being trained both in Political Science and Economics, I aspire to foster the growing connection between both fields. My broader research area is best defined as Political Economy and Development. Methodologically, I like to work empirically, using quantitative data, and in theory building, I often resort to the rigorous language of mathematics to structure my thoughts.</p>

<h3>Working Papers</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/philker/Terrorism-and-preference-for-democracy-in-Africa/blob/master/Grass_is_greener_29_08_2022.pdf">Sometimes the grass is greener on the other side: How terrorism affects preference for democracy</a></p>
<p>I study how negative signals about states' capacity to provide security, i.e. terrorism, affect preference for democracy. I argue that negative signals affect preference formation differently conditional on how democratic a regime is perceived to be. Using interrupted surveys from several African countries, I show that preference for democracy increases in response to terrorist attacks. This effect is particularly pronounced among individuals who evaluate their state as undemocratic. Individuals who perceive their state as democratic show no adverse reaction towards democracy. The results provide a positive outlook on the resilience of preference for democracy in the face of adversity.</p>

<p>Distributive politics and asymmetric mobilization (with Victor Araújo, work in progress draft available on request)</p>

<p>Can broadly targeted welfare policy create electoral dynamics similar to particularistic strategies? We theorize a novel mechanism, we call asymmetric mobilization, which explains mobilization as a self-selection process induced by a broadly targeted benefit. Asymmetric mobilization is based on incomplete information of citizens about the de facto allocation of benefits. When citizens expect particularistic allocation, and access to the benefit depends on voter registration, supporters of the incumbent, who supplies the benefit, self-select into the electorate. This creates an incumbency advantage. We illustrate the argument using the case of the Renda Básica de Cidadania (RBC) in Maricá, Brazil, the largest unconditional cash transfer program in Latin America. Based on qualitative evidence we develop our argument in a formal model, which we test against novel survey data. We find that under the de facto procedure of implementation, supporters of the incumbent supplying the RBC, self-select into the electorate, and engage more in activities, which signal party loyalty.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ifo.de/publikationen/2020/aufsatz-zeitschrift/stabile-demokratie-krisenzeiten-lokale-coronafaelle-haben">Stabile Demokratie in Krisenzeiten: Lokale Coronafälle haben bei der bayerischen Kommunalwahl die Wähler nicht abgeschreckt</a></p>
<p>A short policy report - in German - about the impact of the first occurrences of Covid-19 during the municipal elections in Bavaria on electoral outcomes. Comparing changes of electoral outcomes within municipalities with and without Covid-19 cases, we do not find any evidence that voters were abstaining due to local Covid-19 incidence.

<p>Am 15. März 2020 fanden in Bayern die Kommunalwahlen statt – mitten in den Anfangswochen der Coronapandemie in Deutschland. In etwa einem Fünftel der bayerischen Landkreise gab es zu diesem Zeitpunkt aber noch keinen bestätigten Coronafall. Wir vergleichen das Wahlverhalten in diesen Landkreisen mit bayerischen Landkreisen, in denen bereits Corona nachgewiesen wurde. Unsere Ergebnisse deuten nicht darauf hin, dass lokale Coronafälle die Wahlbeteiligung negativ beeinflusst haben. Die Wähler haben sich nicht abschrecken lassen.
